# <<title>> 

MySWG uses the standard markdown syntax, as defined at
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

To be more precise, 
MySWG uses 
René Jeschke's [Txtmark](https://github.com/rjeschke/txtmark)
that presents some (small) differences with respect original syntax.

Furthermore, 

  * MySWG admits macros as described in [MMD](mmd.html).  
  * MySWG accepts [HTML tables](tables.html).
  * Lines starting with '//' are skipped.
  * \[](URL) works as \[URL](URL)
